# SS-Datas

[遥感数据集仓库](README_CN.md)『Remote sensing datasets warehouse』

SS-Datas is a collection of common datasets of deep learning in the field of remote sensing, including **image and basic annotation information**. Besides, source address and aistudio backup link of datasets are listed to download.

These datasets can be divided into three categories according to image types: **visible, hyperspectral and SAR**. According to task types, they can be divided into **image classification, image segmentation, change detection, object detection, object tracking, multi-label image classification, image generation**, etc.

[RS datasets summary](RS-Data-summary.md) chinese version, the English version will be released soon
